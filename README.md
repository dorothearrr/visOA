You will probably benefit most from this workshop if you install R and the integrated development environment RStudio on your computer. Both are free and easy to install. Here is what you need:
- download and install the latest version of R ([here](https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/cran/))
- download and install the latest version of RStudio (RStudio Desktop, Open Source Edition: [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/))

## Goals
get to know some open data sources for Open Access
- learn how to use open data sources
- learn about the importance of persistent identifiers

get to know some R basics
- learn how to prepare and analyse data
- learn how to visualize data

## The structure of this repository
- **demo** contains R scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for the workshop
- **data** contains all the data you need during the workshop
- after the workshop is over, I will add **solution**: Notebooks outlining all the steps in detail
